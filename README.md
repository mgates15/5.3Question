  Reserved words are the words in a specific programming language, in this case Java, that are reserved for
a particular function. They perform specific actions and instruct the computer to carry out these actions.
Unlike the names of variables, classes, fields, and methods, which are all named by the programmer, the 
reserved words are actually built into Java. Oftentimes in an IDE like Eclipse, the reserved words will be 
highlighted or will stand out in a particular color, so the programmer will be able to easily discern them
from the names he/she has assigned. 
  
  Syntax is very specific and extremely important. Java has a set syntax, and if that syntax is ignored, then
the program will not compile. Programmers have to abide by the syntax of the programming language in order to 
make programs that compile. In an IDE like Eclipse, these errors will be very present, oftentimes in the margin. 

  Unlike syntax, style has no effect on a program's ability to compile, however, it does significantly affect 
readability. If style were eliminated, it would be nearly impossible for other programmers, and oftentimes the
original programmer, to discern what function the program was performing, or what role it played in a larger 
program. Source code is far more easily edited/improved when proper style is adhered to.
